            Early muscle cars were designed with one goal: going fast in a
            straight line. But while some dominated the strip, others
            surprisingly struggled.

            The muscle car craze that kicked off in the 1950s had gathered steam
            and was in full swing during the 1960s. The race was on among
            carmakers and it was basically a question of how big an engine you
            could fit into your car. Unsurprisingly, these carmakers enjoyed
            varying degrees of success with their creations. On one side, you
            had really powerful muscle cars, with loads of horsepower and torque
            to light up the tires and burn some rubber out at the drag strip.
            However, there were also the cars that struggled to put together any
            sort of decent performance and only served to make up the numbers
            during drag races. Let's look at how the best and worst classic
            muscle cars compare when it comes to obliterating the drag strip.
